abc: Assembly Basic Course, FZU, 2017 Fall.

This repository maintains the basic assembly codes for learning assembly language, including:
  * Add two integers;
  * Judge the total number of negative number and positive number in a given array;
  * Find the Max number and the Min number of a given array;
  * Bubble sorting.

Besides, there are also some experiment codes written in interface experiments, including: 
  * Assembly codes which run on Intel 8253 Chip;
  * Assembly codes which run on Intel 8255 Chip;
  * Experiment codes which leverage both 8253 and 8255.

I DONOT provide any support for answering issues, however, the heavy comments on addTwoNumber.asm and maxMinNumber.asm could help you with your problems partly.
